The Adaptive RC Sailing Group is intended to be a community center for exchanging ideas related to 
creating and developing various techniques for those RC skippers who may have undergone 
debilitating injuries or disease. 

Hopefully, participants and contributors will include both those with questions and 
especially those with proposed solutions to situations related to adaptive RC model sailboating.
