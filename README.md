## About

The Adaptive RC Sailing Group is intended to be a community center for exchanging ideas related to creating and developing various techniques for those RC skippers who may have undergone debilitating injuries or disease. Hopefully, participants and contributors will include both those with questions and especially those with proposed solutions to situations related to adaptive RC model sailboating.
